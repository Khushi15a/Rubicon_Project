# 📺 Netflix Viewing History Analysis

This project is a detailed analysis of Netflix viewing history using Python. It explores personal streaming behavior through data and visual storytelling using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This analysis aims to understand trends in Netflix usage—such as what content is watched the most, when users are most active, and what patterns emerge over time. It uses a sample CSV file (`viewing_history.csv`) that mimics actual Netflix watch data. You can replace it with your own viewing activity export from Netflix.
